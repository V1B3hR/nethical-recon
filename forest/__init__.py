Forest module initialization - Infrastructure mapping as trees.

The Forest module maps infrastructure hierarchically:
- Forest: Entire infrastructure
- Trees: Hosts/servers
- Trunks: OS/kernel
- Crowns: Overview/monitoring
- Branches: Processes/services/connections
- Leaves: Threads/sessions/packets

Threats in the canopy:
- Crows: Malware
- Magpies: Data stealers
- Squirrels: Lateral movement
- Snakes: Rootkits
- Parasites: Cryptominers
- Bats: Night attacks
