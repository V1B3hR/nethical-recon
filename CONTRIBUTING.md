### 🔒 Security Contributions

**Found a security vulnerability?**

⚠️ **DO NOT** open a public issue!

Follow our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure:

- Report via GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
- Or email security@nethical-recon.example
- Use PGP encryption for sensitive information

For security-related code improvements that don't involve vulnerabilities, submit a PR as usual but mark it as security-related.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git
- Virtual environment tool (venv, virtualenv, or conda)

### Initial Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/V1B3hR/nethical-recon.git
cd nethical-recon

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# 3. Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
# Or if using pyproject.toml:
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 6. Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# 7. Verify installation
python -m pytest --version
black --version
mypy --version
```

### Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
```

## Coding Standards

We enforce strict coding standards to maintain code quality and consistency.

### Python Style Guide

- **PEP 8** compliance (enforced by Black)
- **Type hints** for all functions and methods (enforced by mypy)
- **Docstrings** for all public modules, classes, and functions (Google style)
- **Line length**: 120 characters (configured in pyproject.toml)

### Code Formatting

**Black** is our code formatter:

```bash
# Format all Python files
black .

# Check formatting without making changes
black --check .

# Show diff of what would be changed
black --check --diff .
```

Black runs automatically via pre-commit hooks.

### Type Checking

**mypy** enforces static type checking:

```bash
# Type check all code
mypy .

# Type check specific file
mypy src/nethical_recon/module.py
```

### Security Scanning

**Bandit** scans for security vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Scan all code
bandit -c pyproject.toml -r .

# Scan specific directory
bandit -r src/
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks automatically run on `git commit`:

- **trailing-whitespace**: Removes trailing whitespace
- **end-of-file-fixer**: Ensures files end with newline
- **check-yaml**: Validates YAML files
- **check-json**: Validates JSON files
- **check-toml**: Validates TOML files
- **check-merge-conflict**: Detects merge conflict markers
- **detect-private-key**: Prevents committing private keys
- **black**: Code formatter
- **bandit**: Security vulnerability scanner
- **mypy**: Static type checker

To run manually:

```bash
# Run on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run on staged files
pre-commit run
```

### Testing

**pytest** is our testing framework:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=nethical_recon --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_specific.py

# Run specific test function
pytest tests/test_specific.py::test_function_name

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run in parallel (if pytest-xdist installed)
pytest -n auto
```

**Test Coverage Requirements:**

- New features must include tests
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Critical paths should have 100% coverage
- Tests should be meaningful, not just for coverage

**Test Structure:**

```python
"""
Test module for [feature name].
"""
import pytest
from nethical_recon import module


class TestFeatureName:
    """Test suite for [feature]."""

    def test_basic_functionality(self):
        """Test basic functionality."""
        # Arrange
        expected = "result"
        
        # Act
        actual = module.function()
        
        # Assert
        assert actual == expected

    def test_edge_case(self):
        """Test edge case handling."""
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            module.function(invalid_input)
```

## Style and Best Practices

### Code Quality

- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoid code duplication
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Prefer simple solutions
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Don't add unnecessary features
- **SOLID** principles for object-oriented code
- **Fail fast**: Validate inputs early
- **Defensive programming**: Handle errors gracefully

### Security Best Practices

- **Never hardcode secrets**: Use environment variables
- **Validate all inputs**: Sanitize user input
- **Use parameterized queries**: Prevent SQL injection
- **Escape output**: Prevent XSS
- **Least privilege**: Request minimum necessary permissions
- **Security by default**: Secure defaults, not opt-in security

### Performance Considerations

- Profile before optimizing
- Use appropriate data structures
- Consider memory usage for large datasets
- Add caching where beneficial
- Use async/await for I/O-bound operations
